<p>I am a software developer and an avid gamer, blending my passion for technology with my love for immersive virtual experiences. With a solid foundation in coding and a knack for problem-solving, I approach software development with enthusiasm and dedication.
This is a game that i made which was inspired from The game called Metal Slug, this game is a 2D platformer pixel art game where you explore  the map filled with enemies so you could go to the next level. </p>

  In this project you will play as the hero to get pass the first level , i wanted to imply the action  genre because it will make the game more fun to play.For game creation, I decided to use the Godot engine which is an engine created in 2014
and what pushed me toward Godot its simplicity and you need to remember that I have no knowledge whatsoever in making a game, so I tried to find a simple and easy to understand engine
And for the creation of the asset, i used Aseprite editor.
